## Tech Stack

- HTML5 for semantic structure and content
- CSS3 for layout, responsive design, and advanced visual effects (orbits, data-network background, sparks)[file:2]
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity, animations, filtering, and form validation[file:4]

## Features

- Light/dark theme toggle with preference saved in `localStorage`.[file:4]
- Responsive navigation bar with active‑section highlighting and scroll progress indicator.[file:2][file:4]
- Hero section with typewriter effect for roles and animated metrics counters.[file:2][file:4]
- Project gallery with category tabs and client‑style project cards.[file:2][file:6]
- Smooth scrolling, reveal‑on‑scroll animations, and tilt effect on the hero card.[file:2][file:4]
- Contact form with basic client‑side validation for required fields and email format.[file:4]

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
- Optional: A local HTTP server (e.g., VS Code Live Server, `python -m http.server`) for best results.

### Running Locally

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Ensure the following files are in the same folder:
   - `index.html`
   - `style.css`
   - `main.js`
   - `eshan.jpg` (profile/hero image)[file:2][file:4][file:6]
3. Open `index.html` directly in your browser  
   **or** start a local server and navigate to `http://localhost:PORT`.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – Main page layout and content sections (hero, about, experience, projects, contact).[file:6]
- `style.css` – Global styles, theme variables, layout, animations, and visual effects.[file:2]
- `main.js` – DOM interactions, theme handling, animations, filters, and form validation logic.[file:4]
- `eshan.jpg` – Display image used in the hero/profile card.

## Customization

- Update text content (name, roles, summary, education, projects) directly in `index.html`.[file:6]
- Adjust colors, spacing, or animations via CSS variables and classes in `style.css`.[file:2]
- Modify roles for the typewriter effect and metrics targets in `main.js`.[file:4]

## Deployment

You can host this portfolio on any static hosting service:

- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Vercel

Just upload the four main files and ensure paths between HTML, CSS, JS, and image remain correct.[file:2][file:4][file:6]
